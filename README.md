# WordProcessor
Reads in words from a text file to keep track of what words were read in and how many times the word was read.

This was the final project in Miami University's Data Abstraction and Data Structures class.

The class that runs the project is the Controller class. The text files included are filled with words that are to be read in and kept track of. Aspects being, what word was read, how many times the word has been read and being able to lookup these statistics based on either giving a word and returning the number of times its been read or a popularity rank which returns the most popular word if a one is given, the second most popular word if a two is given and so on. The Controller class also has "tests" that time how fast each of these methods return information. With test 4 being the most difficult test because it switches between using both methods.

The timing of the tests was used to give grades for this assignment. My project was the second fastest processor in the class.

RUNNING THE PROJECT:
  To run the project, download at least the bin and src folders.
  The text files are necessary for giving the project words to process, but they can be whatever text you would like.
  Each set of tests will run for each text document.
  If the given text files are used, the difficultly of processing a file increases with the number of the file. 1.txt being easier to process than 2.txt and so on.

NOTE: I only wrote Word and WordDictionary. The other classes were provided to us.
